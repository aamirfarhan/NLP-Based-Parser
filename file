3 years later and l'm actually doing great. l have my own
place, a decent job, my pets are doing vey well. My credit
is shit from the divorce but really, l'm in decent company in
that. This isni really a sob stoy; l'm really proud ofwhat l've
done on my own. l just wanted to share for possibly some
closure sin_ l never really got that. Strangers on the
internet are better than keeping it inside for so long. And if
you hate my stoy l just lose some fake points anmay. l
save the_ tem messages to remind myself how Far l've
come, not to cy over. l'm still terrible in relationships but.
